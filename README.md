# PATH FINDING ALGORITHM
You can find a running [demo here](https://5ubstitute.github.com/path_finding).

## Instructions
In the simulation you can generate a 2d-Map randomly, run simulation steps in order to build caves and run the path finding algorithm to find the shortest way from one point on the map to another as long as the two are connected by white spaces.

## Keybindings
Key | Value
--- | -----
e | Clean map
i | Invert map
n | Run simulation step
r | Randomize map

## Mouse
Hold down the **left** button and drag the pointer over the screen to create and remove walls.
Press the **right** button in order to detect reachable spaces and use it on a reachable space in order to trace back the path to the beginning.
